Question 14: Who Is Behind It All?
==================================

| Who was the mastermind behind the whole KringleCon plan?

Answer: *santa*

Solution
--------

After entering the final room and talking to Santa, he says the following:

| You DID IT! You completed the hardest challenge. You see, Hans and the soldiers work for ME. I had to test you. And you passed the test!

| You WON! Won what, you ask? Well, the jackpot, my dear! The grand and glorious jackpot!

| You see, I finally found you!

| I came up with the idea of KringleCon to find someone like you who could help me defend the North Pole against even the craftiest attackers.

| That’s why we had so many different challenges this year.

| We needed to find someone with skills all across the spectrum.

| I asked my friend Hans to play the role of the bad guy to see if you could solve all those challenges and thwart the plot we devised.

| And you did!

| Oh, and those brutish toy soldiers? They are really just some of my elves in disguise.

| See what happens when they take off those hats?

| Based on your victory… next year, I’m going to ask for your help in defending my whole operation from evil bad guys.

| And welcome to my vault room. Where's my treasure? Well, my treasure is Christmas joy and good will.

| You did such a GREAT job! And remember what happened to the people who suddenly got everything they ever wanted?

| They lived happily ever after.


Some fun with the soldier avatars
---------------------------------

With a bit of experiementing we found that we could also find avatars of different coloured soldiers (not just the ones in the room).
