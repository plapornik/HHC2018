Question 13: Santa's Door
=========================

| Use what you have learned from previous challenges to open the `door to Santa's vault <https://pianolockn.kringlecastle.com/>`_. What message do you get when you unlock the door?

Answer: *You have unlocked Santa's vault!*

Solution

The items that were needed to find the door code included:

 - The vault password from :doc:`Question 12 </objectives/question12>`
 - The body of the email message found in :doc:`Question 8 </objectives/question8>`

The vault password was the following musical tune: **ED#ED#EED#EF#G#F#G#ABA#BA#B**.

The email message said that Alabaster's favourite musical key was **D**.

We utilised http://www.simusic.com/transpose.html to determine that the vault password was keyed to **E**. We also used the site to transpose the tune to **D**.

The resulting tune was:
