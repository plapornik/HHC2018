Google Vent
===========

Our first approach was to just try and solve the maze without any maps to help us.
However, as on that day we were kicked off the server quite oftenly.
Thus, we tried to create a map of the maze by counting steps and marking the turns.

 This is the final map produced by Antonios. He was quite bored.

.. tip:: 
 A better use of your time would be to try to solve the objectives as the maps are unlocked in objective 4.


We were quite disappointed to later find those maps in the git repository, while solving objective 4...
