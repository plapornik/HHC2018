 Christmas is coming, and so it would seem,
 ER (Elf Resources) crushes elves' dreams.
 One tells me she was disturbed by a bloke.
 He tells me this must be some kind of joke.
 Please do your best to determine what's real.

 Lethal forensics ain't my cup of tea;
 If YOU can fake it, my hero you'll be.
 One more quick note that might help you complete,
 Clearing this mess up that's now at your feet.
 Certain text editors can leave some clue.
 Did our young Romeo leave one for you?
 - Tangle Coalbox, ER Investigator
