An Alternate Ending by Antonios
===============================

Here are two possible alternate endings for KringleCon:

Explanation 1: Santa is bad
---------------------------

Santa Claus is also known as Saint Nicholas, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas, Sinterklaas, Père Noël, Samichlaus, Joulupukki and Saint Basil.

Santa Claus has commited a variety of crimes over the years including but not limited to: intruding in people's homes, flying without a license and illegal distribution of coal. 

However, this report is about his many (possible) attempts to destroy Christmas.

Part 1: Interviews
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1)	“I received a message saying "URGENT: Your presence is requested at the North Pole". I thus took the TARDIS and travelled there only to be kidnapped (!) by Santa and his elves. He said we should go back in time to steal the original CBBS. I didn't accept, so he threw me in the TARDIS and hijacked the machine. Thankfully, some elves couldn't find Santa and notified SANS. It was by pure luck that Christmas was saved in 2014. I confessed to kidnapping him because he is still my friend"
-Dr Who

2)	 “The dwarves have always been excellent engineers. We were surprised to receive an order from Santa, to create a toy called the Gnome in Your Home. We did everything he asked for, but it seems he changed the software, somehow managing to blame us the ATNAS corporation for it"
-the ATNAS corporation

3)	  "I was contacted by my friend the Grinch, who said "I want to steal Christmas. AGAIN." At the time I didn't know I was actually speaking with Santa, so I sent him an e-mail about this to warn him. It seems that he decided to contact SANS again to avoid suspicion. I was shocked to find out I had been framed for it, but no one would believe me."
-Cindy Lu Who

4)	 "I was quite shocked to find so many weapons in my storage room. I never touched a gun before! It seems that Santa used his magic to hypnotize the snowman so that he could frame me when SANS found out."
-Glinda

5)	 "Grrrrrrrrrrrr... Arrrgh Grrrrrr Roarrrrrr. Grrr arrgh arrrrgh. Roarrrr Grrr Argh Grrrrr. Roarrrrr. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!"
translation: "Well...  Snowman must say Snowman is quite angry. He came to Snowman's cave. Made Snowman believe he was hypnotized by Glinda. Good Glinda. Bad Santa!"
-The abominable snowman

Part 2: Possible Plan 2019
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Santa always wanted to be the only one to give gifts over Christmas. 
Thus, he called a conference and made the best hackers and security specialists (who came) stand outside barefoot. 
This way they would not only be busy solving his challenge but would also be sick and wouldn't be able to use their skills to protect stores globally. 
He would then go in those stores and destroy all the toys there. However, some hackers were too good, and his plan didn't work.


Part 3: Evidence of Santa trying to destroy Christmas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I.	Hans seemed too confident when he talked about releasing the 'bad guys' from the previous years
II.	The challenges needed a wide range of skills. This was to slow the hackers down
III.	Santa kept everyone outside, barefoot until the 18th of December. This was to make them sick and unable to protect other organisations
IV.	Santa had an empty vault, possibly to keep stolen toys
V.	Santa displayed that he is more than capable of creating an evil plan.

Part 4: Possible Motives & Reasons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.	 He is tired of travelling around the globe every year.
2.	He doesn't like sharing people's love
3.	He doesn't know what he is doing (something like paranoia)

Part 5: Reason for Kringlecon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Besides the ones prementioned, it may have been to avert suspicion

Explanation 2: Someone was early and stole Christmas
----------------------------------------------------

Part 1: Interviews
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1)	“I woke up one morning hearing some strange noise in my secret room. I thought the vent was malfunctioning and decided I would fix it in the morning. I was stunned to find the vault empty but had to come up with an excuse and said that it was never full”
-Santa Claus

2)	“As the North Pole’s financial advisor, I was concerned when I found the vault to be empty. Without the resources stored in the vault we wouldn’t be able to manufacture toys and Christmas would be ruined”
-Hans

3)	“I am an extremely forgetful elf. Once, I left my badge to Santa’s secret room in the barn. I forgot to erase it from the database, and someone managed to get in Santa’s secret room. From there they accessed my Password vault and were able to get to Santa’s Vault. I am saddened by the possibility that I aided the destruction of Christmas.”
Alabaster Snowball

4)	“I saw Santa pacing the yard quite anxiously. He was anxiously murmuring that someone stole his secret ‘weapon’. My guess is that it is the Gift-Wrapping Machine.”
-Jason

Part 2: Possible explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given the info, the suspect possibly disguised themselves as an elf and accessed Alabaster’s password vault. They then unlocked the vault and stole its content.
Therefore, possible suspects include: Yoda, Frodo Baggins, the Grinch

Part 3: Evidence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I.	Kringle castle locked down. The extra security suggests that something happened
II.	There is a vent leading to Santa’s secret room. Possible access point
III.	Santa’s vault is empty
IV.	Alabaster lost his badge during the conference
V.	Jason, a plant can talk and see (possible IoT implementation)

Part 4: Motive & Reasons
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1.	They may dislike Christmas
2.	Christmas gifts are costly  stealing something related to them may bring profit
3.	They may like gifts and couldn’t control themselves.

Part 5: Reason for Planning Kringlecon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Santa didn’t want the fact that security at the North Pole was bad to be known.
