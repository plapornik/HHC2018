Google Ventilation Maze
=======================

Our first approach was to just try and solve the maze without any maps to help us.
However, this didn't work too well because on that day we were frequently kicked off the server.
Thus, we tried to create a map of the maze by counting steps and marking the turns.

 This is the final map produced by Antonios.

After spending quite a bit of time creating our own maps, we were quite disappointed to later find those maps in the git repository, while solving :doc:`Question 4 </objectives/question4>`.

 This is the vent diagram of the first floor as found in the zip file in the git repository for question 4. These are unlocked using the password 'Yippe-ki-yay'.
